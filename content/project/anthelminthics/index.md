I lead the Sanger Institute involvement in the first reference genome for *Haemonchus contortus*. *Haemonchus* is widely used as a model in research on anti-nematode anthelminthics, so it was natural to try and use this resource to try and understand the genetic basis of anthelmintihcs resistance. Initially in collaboration with [John Gilleard](https://www.ucalgary.ca/jsgilleard/), and subsequently through leading Sanger's invovlement in a consortium ([the BUG consortium](https://bugconsortium.wordpress.com/)) funded by a BBSRC strategic award, we have identified a candidate locus for resistance to ivermectin in this species, and shown that this is likely to be globally important, partly through investigating the global diversity of *Haemonchus* using genome-wide data.
