I've worked on Cryptosporidium genomics in collaboration with [Carol Gilchrist](https://med.virginia.edu/faculty/faculty-listing/cg2p/) and [Bill Petri](https://med.virginia.edu/faculty/faculty-listing/wap3g/) at the University of Virginia and their colleagues at ICDDR,B in Dhaka to generate some genomic data from a cohort of  Bangaldesh children with diarrhoeal disease. I also contributed to an improved reference genome for *C. parvum*.

In Glasgow, PhD student [Lilly Atkins](https://www.gla.ac.uk/pgrs/lillyatkins/) is working with [Emily Hotchkiss](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/bohvm/staff/emilyhotchkiss/) and I to develop more discriminatory methods to genotype *Cryptosporidium parvum*, and then use them to study the transmission of *Cryptosporidium* within and betwen dairy herds in Scotland and to investigate whether or not *Cryptosporidium* genotype appears to explain any of the variation in virulence among infected calves.
