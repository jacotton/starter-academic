My first involvement in parasitology was through leading reference genome sequencing, assembly and annotation projects for a number of key helminth species of medical and veterinary importance. This inlucdes the nematodes *Haemonchus contortus*, *Globodera pallida* and *Onchocerca volvulus*. I also contributed data or analysis to other projects (*Trichuris muris*, *Strongyloides spp.*, Tsetse fly, *Globodera rostochiensis* and an updated *Brugia malayi*). I played a fairly big part in a large-scale effort to produce reference genomes for most key helminth species, which became the helminth genomes consortium.
