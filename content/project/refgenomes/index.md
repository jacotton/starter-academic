My first involvement in parasitology was through leading reference genome sequencing and assembly projects for the nematodes *Haemonchus contortus*, *Globodera pallida* and *Onchocerca volvulus*. I also contributed data or analysis to other projects (*Trichuris muris*, a bunch of *Strongyloides spp.*, Tsetse fly, *Globodera rostochiensis* and an updated *Brugia malayi*. I played a fairly big part in a large-scale effort to produce reference genomes for most key helminth species, which became the helminth genomes consortium ().
