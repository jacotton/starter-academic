Some content has finally arrived - I think is now a comprehensive list of all of my publications ever - 20 years and 106 items, all with PDFs. Its been quite nice putting it togehter, remembering projects and people i've worked with over the years. I've tried to include things like links to the key people on each paper, and at some point I hope to add a bit of narrative, at least to some of the more recent ones, tags to group content together etc.
