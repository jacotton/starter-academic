After almost 12 years at the Sanger Institute, I've now moved to the [Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/bahcm/)  at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). I'll also be part of the [Wellcome Centre for Integrative Parasitology](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/wcip/). The Parasite Genomics group at Sanger is gradually disappearing..

It's been a great experience in Glasgow so far, and I'm looking forward to being in Scotland full time once we've sold our house and moved children, dog and chickens North.. at the moment i'm travelling up every few weeks. I think there are lots of opportunities to work with the many interesting people in Glasgow. Most obviously, my existing collaborators on anthelminthic resistance are in Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland, and [Matt Berriman](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/wcip/research/researchleaders/berrimangroup/) has also moved to Glasgow. There are also lots of other great parasitologists, including _Schistosoma_ and _Leishmania_ people, but also really strong communities of epidemiologists, vector biologists, and evolutionary biology people.

It is also the same department (with some mergers and name changes through the years) that I did my PhD with [Rod Page](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/bahcm/staff/rodericpage/) in over 20 years ago, so its a little like coming home.
