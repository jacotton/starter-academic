I'm particularly excited about two new papers - describing both the [immunology](https://jacotton.netlify.app/publication/vlhiv_immunology/) and [genome data from parasites](https://jacotton.netlify.app/publication/vlhivgenomes/) in a cohort of VL and VL-HIV patients from Northern Ethiopia. These come out of the PhD work of Yegnasew Takele, a wonderful Ethiopian PhD student at Imperial. Six years after I first met [Pascale Kropf]() to talk about collaborating, these are our first joint publications.. the first of many, as we have lots more exciting data to come on both *L. donovani* and *L. aethiopica* from Yegnasew's work and other projects. Its been a great experience getting to know and work with Ethiopian researchers. With covid and unrest in Ethiopia its been very tough times for out Ethiopian colleagues recently, so its nice to see some publications reflecting their hard work and talent.
