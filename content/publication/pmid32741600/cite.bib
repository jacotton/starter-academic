abstract = {Genetic exchange between Leishmania parasites was demonstrated in sandflies over 10 years ago. Louradour et al. have shown in vitro hybridization of two Leishmania tropica isolates, with the potential to remove a major roadblock to using forward genetics in Leishmania, understanding Leishmania reproductive biology, and analyzing gene flow in natural populations.}
