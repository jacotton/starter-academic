abstract: >
  Genetic exchange between *Leishmania* parasites was demonstrated in sandflies over 10 years ago. Louradour et al. have shown in vitro hybridization of two Leishmania tropica isolates, with the potential to remove a major roadblock to using forward genetics in *Leishmania*, understanding *Leishmania* reproductive biology, and analyzing gene flow in natural populations.
