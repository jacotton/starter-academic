abstract: >
  Patients co-infected with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV-1 (VL/HIV patients)
  suffer from recurrent VL relapses and increased mortality. The aim of our study was
  to test the hypothesis that HIV patients who present with their first episode of VL
  (primary VL/HIV patients) experience less relapses and lower mortality as compared
  to VL/HIV patients who have a previous history of VL relapses (recurrent VL/HIV
  patients). Our results show that primary VL/HIV patients have a lower parasite load
  and that their relapse-free survival is significantly longer. Relapses in both groups of
  patients occur independently of HIV viral load. Our clinical and immunological
  analyses of these patients at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up show that
  the poorer prognosis of recurrent VL/HIV patients is accompanied by lower weight
  gain and lower recovery of all blood cell lineages, as well as lower production of
  antigen-specific IFNg, lower CD4+ T cell counts and higher expression levels of the
  inhibitory receptor PD1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
  We propose that in addition to the current treatments, novel interventions should be
  considered at the time of VL diagnosis in VL/HIV patients and suggest that improved
  anti-leishmanial and antiretroviral treatments, as well as immune therapy, through
  PD1/PDL-1 blockade and/or through IFNg administration, could result in more
  efficient parasite killing and thereby reduce the relapse rate and improve survival.
