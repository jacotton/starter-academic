abstract: >
  Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has emerged as a clinically important opportunistic
  infection in HIV patients, as VL/HIV co-infected patients suffer from frequent VL
  relapse. Here, we followed cohorts of VL patients with or without HIV co-infections in
  Ethiopia and collected detailed clinical and immunological data during 12 months of
  follow-up. By the end of the study 78.1% of VL/HIV patients, but none of the VL only
  patients, had relapsed. Despite clinically defined cure, VL/HIV patients maintained
  high parasite loads, low BMI, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia throughout
  follow-up. During detailed immunological study throughout the follow-up period, we
  identified three markers associated with VL relapse: i) failure to restore antigenspecific production of IFNγ, ii) persistently low CD4+ T cell counts, and iii) high
  expression of PD1 on CD4+ T cells. We show that these three markers combine well
  in predicting VL relapse, and that all three measurements are needed for optimal
  predictive power.
  These three immunological markers can be measured in primary hospital settings in
  Ethiopia and can predict VL relapse after anti-leishmanial therapy. The use of our
  prediction model has the potential to improve disease management and patient care.
