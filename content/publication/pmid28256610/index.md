  Control of pathogens arising from humans, livestock and wild animals can be enhanced by genome-based investigation. Phylogenetically classifying and optimal construction of these genomes using short sequence reads are key to this process. We examined the mammal-infecting unicellular parasite Leishmania adleri belonging to the lizard-infecting Sauroleishmania subgenus. *L. adleri* has been associated with cutaneous disease in humans, but can be asymptomatic in wild animals. We sequenced, assembled and investigated the *L. adleri* genome isolated from an asymptomatic Ethiopian rodent (MARV/ET/75/HO174) and verified it as *L. adleri* by comparison with other Sauroleishmania species. Chromosome-level scaffolding was achieved by combining reference-guided with de novo assembly followed by extensive improvement steps to produce a final draft genome with contiguity comparable with other references. *L. tarentolae* and *L. major* genome annotation was transferred and these gene models were manually verified and improved. This first high-quality draft *Leishmania adleri* reference genome is also the first Sauroleishmania genome from a non-reptilian host. Comparison of the *L. adleri* HO174 genome with those of *L. tarentolae* Parrot-TarII and lizard-infecting *L. adleri* RLAT/KE/1957/SKINK-7 showed extensive gene amplifications, pervasive aneuploidy, and fission of chromosomes 30 and 36. There was little genetic differentiation between *L. adleri* extracted from mammals and reptiles, highlighting challenges for leishmaniasis surveillance.
