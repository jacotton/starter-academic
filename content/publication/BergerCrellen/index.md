abstract: >
 Control and elimination of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis relies on mass administration
 of praziquantel. Whilst these programmes reduce infection prevalence and intensity, their
 impact on parasite transmission and evolution is poorly understood. Here we examine the
 genomic impact of repeated mass drug administration on Schistosoma mansoni populations
 with documented reduced praziquantel efficacy. We sequenced whole-genomes of 198 S.
 mansoni larvae from 34 Ugandan children from regions with contrasting praziquantel exposure. Parasites infecting children from Lake Victoria, a transmission hotspot, form a diverse panmictic population. A single round of treatment did not reduce this diversity with no
 apparent population contraction caused by long-term praziquantel use. We find evidence of
 positive selection acting on members of gene families previously implicated in praziquantel
 action, but detect no high frequency functionally impactful variants. As efforts to eliminate
 schistosomiasis intensify, our study provides a foundation for genomic surveillance of this
 major human parasite
