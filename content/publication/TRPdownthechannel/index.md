  TThe anthelmintic praziquantel (PZQ) is an essential tool in controlling schistosomiasis, so reports of reduced PZQ efficacy are of great public health concern. Le Clec'h et al. recently identified a gene responsible for PZQ resistance in experimentally selected resistant Schistosoma mansoni. The importance of this locus in natural infections remains to be established.
