abstract: >
  We discovered a hybrid Leishmania parasite in Costa Rica that is genetically similar to hybrids from Panama. Genome analyses demonstrated the hybrid is triploid and identified L. braziliensis and L. guyanensisâ€“related strains as parents. Our findings highlight the existence of poorly sampled Leishmania (Viannia) variants infectious to humans.
