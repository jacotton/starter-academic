abstract: >
  The implementation of prospective drug resistance (DR) studies in the R&D pipelines is a common practice for many infectious diseases, but not for Neglected Tropical Diseases. Here, we explored and demonstrated the importance of this approach, using as paradigms *Leishmania donovani*, the etiological agent of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), and TCMDC-143345, a promising compound of the GSK ‘Leishbox’ to treat VL. We experimentally selected resistance to TCMDC-143345 in vitro and characterized resistant parasites at genomic and phenotypic levels. We found that it took more time to develop resistance to TCMDC-143345 than to other drugs in clinical use and that there was no cross resistance to these drugs, suggesting a new and unique mechanism. By whole genome sequencing, we found two mutations in the gene encoding the *L. donovani* dynamin-1-like protein (LdoDLP1) that were fixed at highest drug pressure. Through phylogenetic analysis, we identified LdoDLP1 as a family member of the dynamin-related proteins, a group of proteins that impacts the shapes of biological membranes by mediating fusion and fission events, with a putative role in mitochondrial fission. We found that *L. donovani* lines genetically engineered to harbor the two identified LdoDLP1 mutations were resistant to TCMDC-143345 and displayed altered mitochondrial properties. By homology modeling, we showed how the two LdoDLP1 mutations may influence protein structure and function. Taken together, our data reveal a clear involvement of LdoDLP1 in the adaptation/resistance of *L. donovani* to TCMDC-143345.
