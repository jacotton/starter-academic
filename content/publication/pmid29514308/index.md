abstract: >
  We studied the genetic diversity of *Cryptosporidium hominis* infections in slum-dwelling infants from Dhaka over a 2-year period. *Cryptosporidium hominis* infections were common during the monsoon, and were genetically diverse as measured by gp60 genotyping and whole-genome resequencing. Recombination in the parasite was evidenced by the decay of linkage disequilibrium in the genome over <300 bp. Regions of the genome with high levels of polymorphism were also identified. Yet to be determined is if genomic diversity is responsible in part for the high rate of reinfection, seasonality, and varied clinical presentations of cryptosporidiosis in this population.
