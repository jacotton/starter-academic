               cause debilitating chronic infections of humans and animals,
               decimate crop production and are a major impediment to
               socioeconomic development. Here we report a broad comparative
               study of 81 genomes of parasitic and non-parasitic worms. We
               have identified gene family births and hundreds of expanded gene
               families at key nodes in the phylogeny that are relevant to
               parasitism. Examples include gene families that modulate host
               immune responses, enable parasite migration though host tissues
               or allow the parasite to feed. We reveal extensive
               lineage-specific differences in core metabolism and protein
               families historically targeted for drug development. From an in
               silico screen, we have identified and prioritized new potential
               drug targets and compounds for testing. This comparative
               genomics resource provides a much-needed boost for the research
               community to understand and combat parasitic worms.",
