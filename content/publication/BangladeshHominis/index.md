abstract: >
  Cryptosporidium species are a major cause of diarrhea and associated with growth failure. There is currently only limited knowledge of the parasite's genomic variability. We report a genomic analysis of Cryptosporidium parvum isolated from Bangladeshi infants and reanalysis of sequences from the United Kingdom. Human isolates from both locations shared 154 variants not present in the cattle-derived reference genome, suggesting host-specific adaptation of the parasite. Remarkably 34.6% of single-nucleotide polymorphisms unique to human isolates were nonsynonymous and 8.2% of these were in secreted proteins. Linkage disequilibrium decay indicated frequent recombination. The genetic diversity of C. parvum has potential implications for vaccine and therapeutic design.
